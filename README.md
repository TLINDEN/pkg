# pkg

universal package manager

## intro

A simple wrapper tool for the most used package management tools. It uses the same subcommands as FreeBSD' `pkg` (hence the name) so I don't need to memoize all the other syntaxes.

## supported package systems:

- yum and dnf - CentOS
- zypper - Suse
- pacman - ArchLinux
- xbps - Voidlinux
- pkg - FreeBSD

## Usage

Copy the file pkg to some suitable location. Please note: Bash is required.

Commands are the same as under FreeBSD: https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=pkg&sektion=&n=1.

## license
